input.txt contains a record of 10000 words.

This algorithm works as an approximate string matching using context awareness. If there is an exact match it tells you that there is an exact match to your query. 

To show about the approximate match, It displays the most appropriate match according to the edIndexes of the strings which includes the frequency of the string in DB, the frequency of the same ED in neighbourhood and the ED of the string itself from the query string.

To run a query, execute main.cpp file and enter the query after the database is initialized.
